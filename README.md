## What This Project Does

This project ingests raw data from three public sources, processes it through a Medallion Architecture pipeline (Bronze, Silver, Gold), and produces an interactive Streamlit dashboard with 60+ visuals across 11 analytical tabs.

The pipeline processes 235+ billion transactions worth 345+ trillion INR, spanning 7 years (2018--2024), covering 36 states and 788 districts.

## The Dataset

Three independent, publicly available data sources are used. Each covers a different aspect of UPI.

## Key Findings

These are the main insights extracted from the data. Every number below is computed from the source data, not estimated.

### 1. Market Concentration

UPI is a duopoly. PhonePe holds ~48.8% and Google Pay holds ~36.3% of all transactions. Together, they control ~85% of the market.

- **HHI Index: 0.3767** -- classified as "Highly Concentrated" by US Department of Justice standards (threshold: 0.25)
- **Equivalent firms: 2.7** -- the market behaves as if only ~3 equal-sized firms exist
- NPCI proposed a 30% volume cap per app in 2020. As of 2025, enforcement remains deferred. Both PhonePe and Google Pay exceed this cap.
- Paytm's market share dropped sharply after RBI's regulatory action on Paytm Payments Bank, further consolidating the duopoly.

### 2. Geographic Digital Divide

UPI adoption is concentrated in urban districts. Rural districts lag behind.

- **788 districts analyzed**, classified into 4 adoption tiers (K-Means clustering)
- **50 districts identified as critically underserved** (bottom by transaction volume)
- **Average intra-state Gini coefficient: 0.441** -- moderate-to-high inequality. Within most states, a few urban districts account for the majority of UPI transactions.
- Top states: Maharashtra (3.63 Bn txns), Karnataka (3.46 Bn). Bottom states have transaction volumes 1000x lower.

### 3. Cash Displacement

India is becoming less cash-dependent, not cashless. This is an important distinction.

- **Digital-to-cash ratio: 0.68** -- UPI processes ~68% as much value as total physical cash in circulation each month
- Currency in circulation (physical cash) continues to grow year-over-year despite UPI growth
- UPI is capturing **new transactions** -- street vendors, auto-rickshaws, small shops that previously operated in cash only
- ATM transaction volumes show gradual decline, supporting the digital shift thesis

### 4. Growth Trajectory

UPI transaction volumes have grown from 1.08 Bn (2018) to 99.30 Bn (2024).

- **Latest monthly volume: 19.48 Bn transactions** (Jun 2025)
- **Seasonal peak: October** (Diwali/festive season, factor: 1.042). **Trough: February** (factor: 0.930)
- Prophet and ARIMA models both project volumes reaching ~23 Bn/month by mid-2026
- Average transaction value has been declining -- more small-value payments are being made digitally, indicating deeper financial inclusion

| Phase         | What Happens                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bronze**    | Raw data ingested from 3 sources. PhonePe Pulse: 9,026 JSON files parsed from GitHub. NPCI: curated from official statistics. RBI: curated from DBIE. All stored as Parquet with source metadata.                                            |
| **Silver**    | Standardized column names, type casting, null handling, duplicate removal. State/district name cleaning. Derived fields: fiscal year, YoY growth, avg transaction value. Validated: no nulls in key columns, positive values, no duplicates. |
| **Gold**      | Star schema in DuckDB. 4 dimension tables (date, geography, app, category) + 4 fact tables + 2 analytical views. Exported to Parquet for dashboard consumption.                                                                              |
| **Analytics** | 4 independent modules: Market concentration (HHI), Forecasting (Prophet + ARIMA), Geographic analysis (Gini + K-Means), Cash displacement (ratio analysis). Each produces Parquet outputs.                                                   |

## Analytical Methods

| Method                    | Formula                                                     | What It Measures                                           | Why This Method                                                               |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **HHI**                   | `sum(market_share^2)`                                       | Market concentration (0 = competitive, 1 = monopoly)       | Global standard used by DOJ and EU for antitrust evaluation                   |
| **Gini Coefficient**      | `(2 * sum(i * sorted_val)) / (n * sum(vals)) - (n+1)/n`     | Inequality of UPI adoption across districts within a state | Scale-independent; used by World Bank for income inequality                   |
| **K-Means Clustering**    | 4 clusters on log-scaled features (volume, value, avg size) | District adoption tiers: Very Low, Low, Medium, High       | Finds natural groupings; log-scaling prevents metro districts from dominating |
| **ARIMA(1,1,1)**          | AR(1) + differencing(1) + MA(1)                             | 12-month transaction volume forecast                       | Classical statistical approach; parsimonious for 42 data points               |
| **Prophet**               | Trend + seasonality + holidays                              | 12-month forecast with confidence intervals                | Handles Indian holidays (Diwali, Holi); robust to missing data                |
| **Digital-to-Cash Ratio** | `UPI_value / Currency_in_Circulation`                       | Digital payment penetration relative to physical cash      | Direct scale comparison; growth rates alone can be misleading                 |

## Why This Project Matters

UPI is not just a payment system. It is the financial infrastructure of a country with 1.4 billion people.

- **Scale**: UPI processes more real-time transactions per month than Visa and Mastercard combined in their respective networks
- **Financial inclusion**: The declining average transaction value (from ~1,800 INR to ~1,300 INR) indicates that small-value everyday purchases are moving to digital -- street vendors, auto-rickshaws, tea shops
- **Policy relevance**: The HHI analysis directly informs the NPCI 30% volume cap debate. A duopoly controlling 85% of a national payment system raises systemic risk questions.
- **Geographic inequality**: A Gini of 0.44 for digital payment adoption within states means the benefits of UPI are not evenly distributed. 50 districts remain critically underserved.
- **Cash paradox**: Despite UPI's growth, physical cash in circulation continues to rise. India is not going cashless -- it is adding a digital layer on top of existing cash usage. This finding contradicts the common "cashless India" narrative.

## Running This Project From Scratch

### Prerequisites

| Requirement      | Why                                                | Install                                         |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Python 3.10+** | Required by pandas 2.0, Prophet, DuckDB            | [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) |
| **Git**          | PhonePe Pulse ingester clones a public GitHub repo | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads)    |
| **pip**          | Package installer                                  | Ships with Python                               |

No API keys, credentials, or environment variables are needed. All three data sources are public.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/UPI_DS_Project.git
cd UPI_DS_Project
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs pandas, DuckDB, Plotly, Streamlit, Prophet, statsmodels, scikit-learn, and all other dependencies. Prophet takes the longest to install (~2-3 minutes) because it compiles C++ code.

### Step 3: Run the Data Pipeline

```bash
# Run the full pipeline end-to-end (recommended for first run)
make all
```

This runs four stages in sequence:

| Stage         | Command          | What It Does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Time                                    |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Ingest**    | `make ingest`    | Downloads raw data from 3 sources into `data/bronze/`. PhonePe Pulse: clones their [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/PhonePe/pulse) and parses 9,026 JSON files. NPCI: scrapes official statistics (falls back to curated data if site is JS-rendered). RBI: loads curated currency and ATM data. | ~5-10 min (first run, due to git clone) |
| **Transform** | `make transform` | Cleans and validates all datasets. Standardizes column names, handles nulls, removes duplicates, derives fiscal year/quarter fields, computes YoY growth rates. Output in `data/silver/`.                                                                                                               | ~1-2 min                                |
| **Model**     | `make model`     | Builds a star schema in DuckDB (4 dimension tables + 4 fact tables + 2 views). Exports all tables to Parquet in `data/gold/exports/`.                                                                                                                                                                   | ~2-3 min                                |
| **Analyze**   | `make analyze`   | Runs 4 analytical modules: HHI market concentration, Prophet + ARIMA forecasting, Gini + K-Means geographic analysis, cash displacement ratio analysis. Results saved as Parquet.                                                                                                                       | ~3-5 min                                |

Total first-run time: ~15-20 minutes. Subsequent runs are faster because the PhonePe repo is already cloned (git pull instead of clone).

### Step 4: Launch the Dashboard

```bash
make app
```

Opens the Streamlit dashboard at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501). All 11 tabs should render with data.

### Step 5: Run Tests (Optional)

```bash
make test
```

Runs 28 unit and smoke tests covering chart builders, KPI formatters, and page module imports.

### How Data Flows Through the Pipeline

```
PhonePe Pulse (GitHub) ──┐
NPCI (website)          ──┼── Bronze (Raw Parquet) ── Silver (Cleaned) ── Gold (Star Schema) ── Dashboard
RBI DBIE (curated)      ──┘
```

Each stage reads from the previous layer and writes to the next. You can re-run any individual stage without re-running earlier stages (e.g., `make analyze` only re-runs analytics on existing gold data).

### Where Data Is Stored

```
